    <a href="https://www.grandcentralterminal.com/">Grand Central</a> has been a backdrop for romantic reunions between couples. After the terminal declined in the 1950s, it was more frequently used as a dark, dangerous place, even a metaphor for chaos and disorientation, featuring chase scenes, shootouts, homeless people, and the mentally ill. Almost every scene filmed in the terminal's train shed was shot on Track 34, one of the few platforms without structural columns blocking views." </P>
